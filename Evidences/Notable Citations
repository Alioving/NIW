3.A Mutual Information-Based Many-Objective Optimization Method for EEG Channel Selection in the Epileptic Seizure Prediction Task
Previous research has shown promising results using con-volutional neural networks (CNNs) for epileptic seizureprediction. For example, Hu et al. [22] used a CNN model andachieved an accuracy of 86.25% on the CHB-MIT dataset.The model demonstrated an improvement of nearly 12% inaccuracy for identifying preictal samples closer to a seizure,compared to those further in time. 

4.Epileptic Seizures Detection Using iEEG Signals and Deep Learning Models

In reference [10], the authors addressed a five-category classification problem bydividing the preictal EEG signal into three consecutive segments. The categoriesincluded the interictal state, three preictal states (PreI, PreII, and PreIII), and one 
ictal state. They proposed a CNN algorithm combined with SVM based on DSS (deepsupervised–supervised) and achieved an overall accuracy of 86.25% after 80 fixediterations

6.Patient-specific solution of the electrocorticography forward problem in deforming brain
With a large amount of data, it outperforms traditional feature extraction in terms of classification accuracy ( Hu et al., 2019 ). 


7.An Intelligent Epileptic Prediction System Based on Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform and Multi-Level Feature CNN for Smart Healthcare IoT
Other studies [23][24][25][26][27] used the raw EEG signals without any preprocessing and also achieved good results in predicting epileptic seizures. Besides, Cao and Hu et al. [28][29][30][31] achieved multi level prediction of epilepsy and obtained good results using the Mean Amplitude Spectrum (MAS)

8.Pediatric Epilepsy Assessment Based on EEG Analysis
[5] use power spectral analysis to extract features per subject for each time window, while Hu et al. [6] propose the partition of the preictal interval and distinguish the preictal subintervals from each other, in order to detect the preictal state
