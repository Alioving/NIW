Hierarchy Graph Convolution Network and Tree Classification for Epileptic Detection on Electroencephalography Signals

引用上下文
Hu et al. [2] and Cao et al. [10] classified interictal, preictal-I, preictal-II, preictal-III, and ictal courses of 5-class by conducting cross-validation experiments. The comparison
drawn between the proposed model and the above-mentioned works is presented in the 5-class cross-validation part of Table VI. The confusion matrices of the state-of-the-art model
and the proposed model are illustrated in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively, which show that the accuracy of the preictal-I, preictal-II, and preictal-III category of the proposed model is
significantly better than the state of the art with an improvement of 8.5%, 12.6%, and 9.3%, respectively. In summary, the proposed HGCN+TC+PF model shows a 5.77% improvement in accuracy compared with the state of the art.

Previous research has shown promising results using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for epileptic seizure
prediction. For example, Hu et al. [22] used a CNNmodel and
achieved an accuracy of 86.25% on the CHB-MIT dataset.
The model demonstrated an improvement of nearly 12% in
accuracy for identifying preictal samples closer to a seizure,
compared to those further in time.

In previous research works, researchers
used dissimilar classifcation methodologies and features
to classify the epileptic seizure classes. Two major diffculties faced by the researchers in the existing studies
are; need more manual analysis and attain only reasonable
performance in epileptic seizure detection (Hu et al. 2019;
Anupallavi and MohanBabu 2020). In order to reduce
more manual intervention and to improve the performance
of epileptic seizure recognition, a new automated system
is proposed in this study

Hu et al. [2] and Cao et al. [10] classified interictal,
preictal-I, preictal-II, preictal-III, and ictal courses of 5-class
by conducting cross-validation experiments. The comparison
drawn between the proposed model and the above-mentioned
works is presented in the 5-class cross-validation part of
Table VI. The confusion matrices of the state-of-the-art model
and the proposed model are illustrated in Fig. 6(a) and (b),
respectively, which show that the accuracy of the preictal-I,
preictal-II, and preictal-III category of the proposed model is
significantly better than the state of the art with an improvement of 8.5%, 12.6%, and 9.3%, respectively. In summary, the
proposed HGCN+TC+PF model shows a 5.77% improvement
in accuracy compared with the state of the art.

Cao et al. proposed a method
to predict seizures using a stacked CNN (SCNN) model
composed of different CNN structures, characterized by the
average amplitude spectrum map (MAS) of the α, β, θ, and
γ rhythms of sEEG signals. They applied an adaptive feature
weighting fusion algorithm to the classification process,
which greatly enhanced the performance of the model [20]
