Previous research has shown promising results using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for epileptic seizure
prediction. For example, Hu et al. [22] used a CNNmodel and
achieved an accuracy of 86.25% on the CHB-MIT dataset.
The model demonstrated an improvement of nearly 12% in
accuracy for identifying preictal samples closer to a seizure,
compared to those further in time.
